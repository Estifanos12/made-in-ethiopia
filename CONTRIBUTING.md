### Pull Request Pro Tips

* [Fork](http://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it locally.
Connect your local repository to the original `upstream` repository by adding it as a [remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/).
Pull in changes from `upstream` often so that you stay up to date and so when you submit your pull request,
merge conflicts will be less likely. See more detailed instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).
* Create a [branch](http://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for your edits.
* Contribute in the style of the project as outlined above. This makes it easier for the collaborators to merge
and for others to understand and maintain in the future.
